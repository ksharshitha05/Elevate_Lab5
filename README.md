# Train-Test Split & Evaluation Metrics – Task 5

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **Task 5: Train-Test Split & Evaluation Metrics** completed as part of an **AI & ML Internship**.

The objective of this task is to:
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train a machine learning model
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Understand model behavior and prediction quality

The entire workflow is implemented in **Google Colab** with automated saving of outputs.

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Built a machine learning pipeline
4. Trained a Logistic Regression model
5. Predicted results on test data
6. Evaluated performance using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
7. Generated and saved confusion matrix
8. Automatically saved evaluation report and interpretation

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness of the model
- **Precision**: Measures correctness of positive predictions
- **Recall**: Measures ability to identify actual positive cases
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows true vs predicted classifications

---

## ✅ Final Outcome
- Model trained successfully
- Evaluation metrics calculated and saved
- Confusion matrix visualized and stored
- Clear understanding of model evaluation fundamentals
- Project is reproducible and GitHub-ready

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
2. Upload the Heart Disease dataset (`heart.csv`)
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. All outputs will be saved automatically
